      Part I
<p>
One day, Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up to find himself
transformed into a giant insect (the most common translation of the
German description ungeheur Ungeziefer, literally "monstrous
vermin"). He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman
is. As he looks at the wall clock, he notices that he has overslept
and missed his train for work. He ponders the consequences of this
delay. Gregor becomes annoyed at how his boss never accepts excuses or
explanations from any of his employees no matter how hard-working they
are, displaying an apparent lack of trusting abilities. Gregor's
mother knocks on the door, and he answers her. She is concerned for
Gregor because he is late for work, which is unorthodox for
him. Gregor answers his mother and realizes that his voice has
changed, but his answer is short, so his mother does not notice. His
sister, Grete, to whom he is very close, then whispers through the
door and begs him to open it. He tries to get out of bed but is
incapable of moving his body. While trying to move, he finds that his
office manager, the chief clerk, has shown up to check on him. He
finally rocks his body to the floor and calls out that he will open
the door shortly.

Offended by Gregor's delayed response in opening the door, the clerk
warns him of the consequences of missing work. He adds that Gregor's
recent performance has been unsatisfactory. Gregor disagrees and tells
him that he will open the door shortly. Nobody on the other side of
tnhe door has understood a single word he had uttered as Gregor's
voice has also transformed, and they conclude that he is seriously
ill. Finally, Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his
mouth. He apologizes to the office manager for the delay. Horrified by
Gregor's appearance, his mother faints, and the manager bolts out of
the apartment. Gregor tries to catch up with him, but his father
drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled
newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway,
and his father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls asleep.
Part II

Gregor awakens and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his
room. Initially excited, he quickly discovers that he has no taste for
milk, once one of his favorites. He settles himself under a couch. The
next morning, his sister comes in, sees that he has not touched the
milk, and replaces it with rotting food scraps, which Gregor happily
eats. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans
up while he hides under the couch, afraid that his appearance will
frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his
family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial
situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can't provide for
them. Gregor had plans of sending Grete to the conservatory to pursue
violin lessons, something everyone else – including Grete – considered
a dream. His incapability of providing for his family, coupled with
his speechlessness, reduces his thought process greatly. Gregor also
learns that his mother wants to visit him, but his sister and father
will not let her.

Gregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins
climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor's new
pastime, Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor
more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away, but Gregor
finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on
the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and fur
muff. Gregor's mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes
out. Grete angrily calls out to Gregor – the first time anyone has
spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of
the room and into the kitchen. He encounters his father, who has just
returned home from work. The father throws apples at Gregor, and one
of them sinks into a sensitive spot in his back and remains lodged
there, paralyzing his movements for a month and damaging him
permanently. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is
severely injured.  Part III

One evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor's door open while three
boarders, whom the family has taken on for additional income, lounge
about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for
them, and Gregor – who usually takes care to avoid crossing paths with
anyone in the flat – creeps out of his bedroom to listen in the midst
of his depression and resultant detachment. The boarders, who
initially seemed interested in Grete, grow bored with her performance,
but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the boarders spots Gregor, and
the rest become alarmed. Gregor's father tries to shove the boarders
back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that
they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the
disgusting conditions in the apartment.

Grete, who has by now become tired of taking care of Gregor and is
realizing the burden his existence puts on each one in the family,
tells her parents they must get rid of Gregor, or they will all be
ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and
would leave of his own accord. Gregor does, in fact, understand and
slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family
of his presence, Gregor dies.

Upon discovering Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of
relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the
cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor's body. The family takes a
trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their
finances. They decide to move to a smaller apartment to further save
money, an act they were unable to carry out in Gregor's
presence. During this short trip, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa realize that, in
spite of going through hardships which have brought an amount of
paleness to her face, Grete appears to have grown up into a pretty and
well-figured lady, which leads her parents to think about finding her
a husband.
